# Vigorous_lateral_export
Numerical code used for the experiments in "Vigorous lateral export of the meltwater outflow from beneath an Antarctic ice shelf", Naveira-Garabato et al., Nature

This repository holds code which allows the numerical experiments described in
the paper to be reproduced.  There are two parts to the repo.  The first part
"model_inputs" contains the python code used to generate the binary files for
the model initial condition.  The second part contains the MITgcm model code.
